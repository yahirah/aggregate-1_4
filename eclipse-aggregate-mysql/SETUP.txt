To set up a MySQL development version, do the following:

(0) get the eclipse-aggregate-gae project built and runnable.

(1) copy the war directory of eclipse-aggregate-gae into this directory.

(2) delete the file:

war/WEB-INF/lib/odk-gae-settings-latest.jar

(3) Run the ODK Aggregate installer to generate a MySQL-based local server. 
Specify all the parameters, and get the server running on port 8080, with a database configured and working.

(4) Stop the Tomcat 6.0 server that this ODK Aggregate is running under.

(5) Copy the ODKAggregate-settings.jar from the WEB-INF/lib directory of the 
generated ODK Aggregate war into this project's war/WEB-INF/lib directory.

(6) Configure a new Tomcat 6.0 server with an Installed JRE (not the workspace default).
This should replace the "Apache Tomcat v6.0 (2)" server target.

You should now be able to run on port 8080 of that new server. 

It is apparently normal for the minimized jquery Javascript to fail validation. You can ignore that.

=============================
Issues
------

The server seems to have a hard time getting source code changes
published to it. A solution that works is to:

Stop the server

Clean... the server

Start the server
