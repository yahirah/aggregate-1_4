maven_local_installs -- contains the maven commands to register these jars into your repo.

Summary of what is installed.

# javarosa-libraries:

This is a special build of javarosa using the tree at https://bitbucket.org/m.sundt/javarosa
It incorporates multithread-safe KoBo collect changes (from Clayton), abandons J2ME support, 
exposes bind and prompt attributes, and numerous contributed fixes from SurveyCTO and others.

# odk-httpclient-gae-1.1.2:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and running 'mvn install' in the GaeHttpClient project.  

# odk-tomcatutil-1.0.1:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and running 'mvn install' in the TomcatUtils project.  Or,

# gwt-google-maps-v3-1.0.1:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and building the gwt-google-maps-v3 project. 
See the Aggregate (Components) README.txt file for how this was built. It
uses the sources that were originally located here (but have since been removed):
http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-maps-v3/

JARs built by others
----------------------

# gwt-visualization-1.1.2:

The sources are in the jar. The full project can be found in 
the Aggregate (Components) project. It is copied from the download
formerly available here:
  http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/

# gdata-src.java-1.47.1 -- various jars:

maven_gdata_installs -- a list of the jars used and the maven commands to install them.

The gdata libraries need to be locally installed into Maven.  

The googlecode-gdata-src.java-1.47.1.zip contains the sources from:
 http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/downloads/list

 The new location for this is here:
 https://github.com/google/gdata-java-client/archive/master.zip
 
but that is not binary-identical to what was on googlecode. e.g.,
the spreadsheet library is the version 1.0 library, instead of the 
3.0 library found on googlecode.

The ANT build script has code commented out that would pull from 
the github repo. Instead, we explode the googlecode zip and register
the jars within it.
