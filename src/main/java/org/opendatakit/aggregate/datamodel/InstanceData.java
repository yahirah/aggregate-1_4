/**
 * For use by dynamically discovered tables.  Tables that 
 * have specific structures required by Aggregate should 
 * extend InstanceDataBase.
 * <p>
 * All instance data for an xform is stored in {@link TopLevelInstanceData}
 * or {@link InstanceData} tables.  Each xform is stored in its own 
 * independent set of tables, enabling easy data migration.
 * <p>
 * The xml tag for the xform's instance data field is used to name
 * the specific column that holds that tag's data value. 
 * <p>Databases generally have an upper limit to how many columns a
 * database table can have.  If the xform exceeds this limit, the 
 * data fields will be split across one primary table and one or more
 * phantom tables with the <code>PARENT_AURI</code> of the phantom 
 * tables pointing to the row of the primary table from which this 
 * phantom table was cleaved.  
 * <p>Each repeat group in an xform is represented as its own 
 * InstanceData table with the <code>PARENT_AURI</code> pointing to
 * the enclosing repeat group (if it is nested within one) or to the
 * top level xform table. 
 * <p>Non-repeat groups are not split into separate tables; their 
 * instance data fields are in-lined into the enclosing repeat group
 * (if it is nested within one) or into the top level xform table.
 * <p>Each selection choice data field exists as a separate
 * {@link SelectChoice} table. This is 
 * to support multiple-choice selections and to allow a single-choice 
 * selection to be easily converted into a multiple-choice selection 
 * without altering the structures of the tables.
 * <p>Each binary data field exists as a separate 
 * {@link BinaryContent}
 * table and associated 
 * {@link BinaryContentRefBlob}
 *  and {@link RefBlob}
 * table.  Together, these support binary data attachments either as 
 * standalone tables or for submissions.
