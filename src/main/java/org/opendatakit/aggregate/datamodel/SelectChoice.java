/**
 * Selection choices are stored in separate tables for each 
 * instance data field. Multiple-choice selections have 
 * multiple values for a given <code>PARENT_AURI</code>.
 * The order of these values as they were submitted is given
 * by the <code>ORDINAL_NUMBER</code> of the selection.
 * Thus, this representation can support ordered lists of
 * selections as well as simple sets of selections (where the
 * order is just a side-effect of the serialization mechanism).
 * Having all selections, even single-choice selections broken
 * out into separate tables allows for transparent modification
 * of a selection from a select-1 to a select-many, or an 
 * ordered selection as revisions occur without impacting the 
 * data representation (note, however, that data interpretation
 * would need to account for the changing value-set of the field).
